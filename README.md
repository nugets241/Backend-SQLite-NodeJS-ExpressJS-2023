#  Nodejs Sqlite Rest Api 2023

This repository contains a Node.js application that implements a RESTful API using SQLite, along with a collection of SQL scripts for database management and exercise solutions.

## Structure

- `/project`: Contains the Node.js application. This application is a RESTful API that allows for operations like retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting user data. It uses SQLite as the database. This directory also includes `project.pdf`, which contains the project report or documentation explaining the project with code snippets and other relevant information. Refer to the README inside the project directory for detailed information.

- `/ExerciseSolutionsSQLite`: Contains SQL scripts that are solutions to various SQL exercises.

## Getting Started

To start using this project, you will need to set up both the Node.js application and the SQLite database.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- SQLite command-line utility for running SQL scripts.

### Setting up the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/project` directory and follow the instructions in the README there to set up the Node.js application.
3. Navigate to the `/sql` directory and follow the instructions in the README there to set up and manage the SQLite database.

### Using the Exercise Solutions

The `/ExerciseSolutionsSQLite` directory contains SQL scripts that are solutions to various SQL exercises. You can run these scripts using the SQLite command-line utility with the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 database.db < ExerciseSolutionsSQLite/<script>.sql
```

Please note that these operations will directly affect the database and cannot be undone. Always ensure to have a backup of your data.
